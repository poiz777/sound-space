### SOME NOTES
This Symfony-4 Micro-App is not documented since it is only a Playground. However All Methods and Functions have long but Descriptive names that allows you to determine 
instantly what each of them does in the Program. 


A Few Screenshots were also added to the top Directory with the name: **-SCREENSHOTS-**.
The App contains Command-Line Utilities as well, some of which are depicted in the bundled Screenshots.
It's important to keep in mind that this is only a Micro-App. Certain expected Functionality may be lacking.
This is to be expected for a mere Playground-Application. The App is also internationalized, though.
This Micro-App uses SQLite3 Database which was also bundled with the entire Package.
